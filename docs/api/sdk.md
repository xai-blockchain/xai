# SDK Integration (Placeholder)

Official SDKs are not yet published. For now:

- Use the REST/WS endpoints in `docs/api/openapi.yaml` and `docs/api/websocket_messages.md`.
- Python clients can call REST with `requests` or `httpx`; ensure you include `X-API-Key`/Bearer tokens as required.
- When SDKs are released, this document should describe installation, auth helpers, typed models, and examples.***
