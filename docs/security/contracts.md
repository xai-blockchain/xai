# Smart Contract Security Guide (Placeholder)

Contract security guidance is pending. In the meantime:
- Follow audit-grade patterns (no unchecked external calls, enforce access control, validate inputs).
- Use formal verification/static analysis where applicable.
- Reference precompile/VM tests for execution correctness.
- Use signing UX rules from `docs/api/wallet_signing.md` for contract interactions.
