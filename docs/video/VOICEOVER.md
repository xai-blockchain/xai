## Scene 1: Introduction (15 sec)

**[Upbeat music fades in]**

"Welcome to XAI, the AI-powered blockchain platform that makes trading and transactions simple, secure, and lightning-fast. In the next five minutes, we'll show you everything you need to get started with the XAI Mobile Wallet. Let's dive in!"

**[Music transitions]**

## Scene 2: Download & Install (30 sec)

"First, let's get the app. Open the App Store on iOS or Google Play on Android, and search for 'XAI Wallet.' Tap the download button, and the app will install in seconds. It's completely free, with no signup required."

**[Pause for download animation]**

"Once installed, tap the XAI icon to open the app. You'll see our terms of service. Take a moment to review them, then tap 'Accept' to continue."

**[Button tap sound effect]**

## Scene 3: Create Wallet (45 sec)

"Now, let's create your wallet. On the welcome screen, tap 'Create New Wallet.' Give your wallet a name, something easy to remember, like 'My XAI Wallet.'"

**[Keyboard typing sound effect]**

"Next, we'll set up biometric security. This could be Face ID on iPhone or fingerprint on Android. Simply follow the on-screen prompts to enable it."

**[Success chime]**

"Great! Now here's the most important step: your recovery phrase. This 12-word phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose your phone. Write these words down on paper, in order, and store them somewhere safe. Never take a screenshot, and never share this phrase with anyone. Not even XAI support will ever ask for it."

**[Warning tone]**

"Once you've written it down, tap 'Continue.' You'll need to verify you wrote it correctly by selecting the right words. If you pass, your wallet is created and secured!"

**[Success chime + confetti sound]**

---

## Scene 4: Get Testnet Tokens (30 sec)

"Your wallet is set up, but you'll need some tokens to try it out. Tap the 'Receive' button at the bottom of your screen. You'll see your unique wallet address and a QR code."

"Tap 'Copy Address' to copy it to your clipboard. Now, open your browser and go to faucet dot xai dot network. Paste your address into the input field, complete the quick verification, and tap 'Request Tokens.'"

**[Success chime]**

"Within seconds, you'll receive a notification that 100 testnet XAI tokens have arrived in your wallet. Your balance updates automatically. Easy!"

## Scene 5: Send Transaction (45 sec)

"Now let's send some XAI. Tap the 'Send' button from your dashboard. You have two options: you can scan a recipient's QR code with your camera, or paste their address manually. Let's scan a QR code."

**[Camera shutter sound]**

"Once scanned, the address auto-fills. Now enter the amount you want to send. Let's try 25 XAI. Review the transaction details carefully. You'll see the recipient address, the amount, and a small network fee."

"When you're ready, tap 'Confirm.' Your phone will prompt you for biometric authentication. Just look at your phone or place your finger on the sensor."

**[Success chime]**

"Authenticated! Your transaction is now being broadcast to the XAI network. In just a few seconds, you'll see a confirmation screen with your transaction hash. You can tap 'View in Explorer' to see it on the blockchain."

**[Success sound]**

## Scene 6: View History (20 sec)

"Want to see all your transactions? Tap 'History' at the bottom of the screen. Here, you'll see a complete list of everything you've sent and received, with pending transactions clearly marked."

"Tap any transaction to see full details: the timestamp, block number, amount, fees, and more. You can even tap 'View in Block Explorer' to verify it directly on the XAI blockchain. Complete transparency!"

---

## Scene 7: Security Tips (15 sec)

"Before we wrap up, here are four quick security tips to keep your XAI safe."

"One: Never share your recovery phrase with anyone. Ever."

"Two: Always keep biometric authentication enabled."

"Three: Double-check recipient addresses before sending. Blockchain transactions can't be reversed."

"And four: When trying something new, start with a small test transaction."
