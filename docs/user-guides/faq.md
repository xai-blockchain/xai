# FAQ

## Why am I getting HTTP 401/403 errors?
- Ensure you include `X-API-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` when required.
- CSRF is enforced on state-changing endpoints; fetch a CSRF token via `/csrf-token` and include it in headers/forms.

## Why do I see 413/429 responses?
- 413: Your payload exceeds `API_MAX_JSON_BYTES` / `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`. Reduce body size.
- 429: Rate limit exceeded. Back off and retry after the window resets; see `docs/api/rate_limits.md`.

## How do I fix “Invalid address prefix: must start with XAI or TXAI”?
- Use addresses generated by the wallet. Random strings fail validation.

## Why was my transaction rejected as stale?
- `/send` enforces a timestamp window. Ensure your client clock is synchronized and payload timestamp is recent.

## Where is my mnemonic/private key stored?
- Never sent to the server by default. Use encrypted keystores and QR backups (`docs/user-guides/mnemonic_qr_backup.md`), and keep passwords safe.

## How do I enable TOTP 2FA?
- Run `xai-wallet 2fa-setup --wallet <name>` and follow `docs/user-guides/wallet_2fa.md`.

## My WebSocket disconnects unexpectedly.
- Respect rate limits, validate messages, and resubscribe after backoff. See `docs/api/websocket.md` for formats.

## How do I report a security issue?
- Follow `SECURITY.md` and use the listed disclosure channel. Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.***
