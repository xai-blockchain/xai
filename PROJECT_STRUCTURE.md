# Project Structure

This document outlines the reorganized structure of the Crypto project. The goal of this reorganization is to improve clarity, maintainability, and scalability by grouping related files and modules into logical directories.

## Top-Level Directories

*   `.git/`: Git version control metadata.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
*   `.mcp.json`: Project-specific configuration file (purpose to be clarified if needed).
*   `.pytest_cache/`: Cache directory for pytest.
*   `pytest.ini`: Configuration file for pytest.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies for the project.
*   `docs/`: Contains all project documentation, including:
    *   `AIXN_Marketing_Campaign_Plan.md`: Marketing campaign plan.
    *   `MINING_BONUS_PROJECT_COMPLETE.txt`: Notes on mining bonus project completion.
    *   `aixn_docs/`: Documentation specific to the AIXN blockchain.
    *   `examples/`: Example code or usage demonstrations.
*   `scripts/`: Contains various utility scripts for development, deployment, and maintenance.
    *   `grant_codex_permissions.ps1`: PowerShell script for granting permissions.
    *   `aixn_scripts/`: Scripts specific to the AIXN blockchain.
    *   `deploy/`: Deployment-related scripts.
    *   `tools/`: General development tools or helper scripts.
*   `config/`: Global configuration files for the project.
*   `data/`: Top-level data directory (purpose to be clarified if needed, might be deprecated).
*   `src/`: Contains all primary source code for the project.
    *   `aixn/`: The core AIXN blockchain application.
        *   `core/`: Core blockchain logic, consensus, and fundamental modules.
        *   `ai/`: AI-related modules and integrations.
            *   `ai_assistant/`: Personal AI assistant implementation.
        *   `alerts/`: Alerting mechanisms.
        *   `browser_wallet_extension/`: Code for browser-based wallet extensions.
        *   `config/`: Configuration files specific to AIXN.
        *   `data/`: Persistent data storage for AIXN components.
            *   `crypto_deposits/`: Data related to cryptocurrency deposits.
            *   `exchange_data/`: Data related to the exchange functionality.
            *   `gamification_data/`: Data for gamification features.
            *   `mining_data/`: Data related to mining operations.
            *   `recovery_data/`: Data for social recovery features.
            *   `wallet_trade_data/`: Data for wallet trade history.
        *   `dashboards/`: Dashboard-related code or assets.
        *   `electron/`: Electron-specific code (if applicable for desktop app).
        *   `embedded_wallets/`: Implementations for embedded wallet solutions.
        *   `google/`: Google-related integrations or services.
        *   `logs/`: Log files generated by the AIXN application.
        *   `openai/`: OpenAI-related integrations or services.
        *   `prometheus/`: Prometheus monitoring configurations or exporters.
        *   `templates/`: HTML templates or other templating files.
        *   `wallets/`: Wallet management and related functionalities.
*   `tests/`: Contains all test files for the project.
    *   `data_test/`: Test data.
    *   `data_testnet/`: Test data for testnet.
    *   `aixn_tests/`: Tests specific to the AIXN blockchain.
*   `secure_keys/`: Contains sensitive key management and storage.
    *   `aixn_secure_keys/`: Secure keys specific to the AIXN blockchain.

## Unresolved Items / Known Issues

*   **Permission Denied Directories:** The following directories could not be deleted due to permission issues and remain in the root directory:
    *   `archived_C_UsersdecriGitClonesCryptoaixn`
    *   `archived_UsersdecriGitClonesCryptoaixn`
    *   `XAI`
    These directories should be manually reviewed and deleted if no longer needed, potentially requiring elevated permissions.
*   **Top-level `data/` directory:** The purpose of the top-level `data/` directory is currently unclear. It might be an artifact or intended for a different purpose than `src/aixn/data/`. It should be investigated and either used, moved, or deleted.
*   **Import Paths:** All import paths within the Python codebase need to be updated to reflect the new directory structure. This is the next major step.
