#   pip install wasmer            # WebAssembly support (recommended)
#   pip install wasmtime          # WebAssembly support (alternative)

# Python code execution (REQUIRED for Python mini-apps)
RestrictedPython>=6.0

# WebAssembly execution (OPTIONAL - choose one)
# wasmer>=1.0          # Recommended - faster JIT compilation
# wasmtime>=1.0        # Alternative - good WASI support
# wasm3                # Lightweight interpreter

# Linux syscall filtering (OPTIONAL - Linux only)
