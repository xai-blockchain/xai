We take security seriously and welcome reports from the community.

- Scope: All code under `src/` and the node/wallet components documented in the repository.
- Reporting: Email security reports to security@xai.org. Do not open public tickets for sensitive issues.
- Response: We acknowledge critical reports within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or remediation plan as soon as possible.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)

Out of scope examples:
- Issues in third-party dependencies not vendored in this repository
- Findings requiring unrealistic permissions or non-default configurations

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
