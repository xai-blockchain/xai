# Deployment

Deployment tooling (Terraform, Ansible, and helper scripts) lives under `deploy/`. This material is intended as a starting point and will require environment-specific adjustments.

## Layout

- `deploy/terraform/` - infrastructure provisioning
- `deploy/ansible/` - configuration management
- `deploy/scripts/` - helper scripts

Review the files in those directories before use.
