# XAI Blockchain - Documentation Audit Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-01-01

## Status

- Documentation audit complete; validation tasks remain.

## Roadmap

### Validation

- [ ] Run full test suite with a longer timeout (low-priority scheduling to avoid overload)
- [ ] Ensure faker/hypothesis are tracked in test/dev requirements

## Details

## Goal
Prepare the repository documentation for a public testnet by removing non-standard materials, tightening language, and ensuring the remaining docs match the code and current workflows.

## Audit Tasks
- [x] Inventory documentation and classify keep/remove; record decisions and task list
- [x] Remove non-customary documentation (internal reports, archives, marketing, duplicates)
- [x] Update top-level docs for accuracy and concision (README, CHANGELOG, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING)
- [x] Review remaining docs for accuracy (quickstart, testnet, API, protocol) and update or remove
- [x] Final sweep for prohibited language, broken links, and inconsistent instructions
