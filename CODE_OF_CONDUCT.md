## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not
limited to:

- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Discord servers and channels
- Social media accounts and posts
- Community forums and mailing lists
- In-person and virtual events, meetups, and conferences
- Direct communications related to project work

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing
the community in public spaces, such as using an official email address, posting
via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative
at an event.

Behavior outside community spaces may be considered if it has the potential to
adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Reporting & Enforcement

### How to Report

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: info@xaiblockchain.org

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (usernames, real names) of any individuals involved
- Description of the behavior and why you consider it a violation
- Date, time, and location (channel, repository, etc.) of the incident
- Any additional context or evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)
- Whether you would like your report to remain confidential

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Reports will be acknowledged within 48 hours
2. **Review**: The report will be reviewed fairly
3. **Decision**: Appropriate action will be determined based on the guidelines below
4. **Communication**: The reporter and involved parties will be informed of the outcome
5. **Follow-up**: The situation will be monitored to ensure compliance and safety

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. We will maintain confidentiality to the extent possible
while conducting a fair review.

## Addressing & Repairing Harm

We believe in restorative justice where possible. Our goal is not only to address
violations but to repair harm and, when appropriate, provide paths for individuals
to return to good standing in the community.

Community leaders will consider:

- The severity and impact of the violation
- Whether this is a first-time or repeated offense
- The violator's willingness to acknowledge harm and make amends
- The safety and well-being of affected community members
- The overall health of the community

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences for
violations of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Minor violations, inappropriate language, or unprofessional
behavior that does not rise to the level of harassment.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior
was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions
that negatively impact the community.

**Consequence**: A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior. This
includes no interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior or a severe single incident.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time (typically 7-90
days). No public or private interaction with the people involved, including
unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed
during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or
aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community. This decision is reserved for severe cases and repeated violations.

## Appeals

Anyone subject to enforcement action may appeal the decision by contacting
the project leadership at info@xaiblockchain.org within 14 days of the
decision. Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders who were not involved
in the original decision when possible.

Appeals should include:

- The original decision being appealed
- Why you believe the decision should be reconsidered
- Any additional context or evidence not previously considered
