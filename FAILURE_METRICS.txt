TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Test Progress (Initial Run):

0-1%:     Consensus tests start - ALL FAIL
1-3%:     Mining tests start - ALL FAIL
3-5%:     Multi-node tests - MOSTLY FAIL
5-6%:     Network tests - MOSTLY FAIL
6-7%:     Wallet tests - MOSTLY PASS
7%+:      Other tests - MOSTLY PASS

Pattern: Most failures concentrated in first 7% of tests (integration/system level)

FIX DIFFICULTY ESTIMATION
================================================================================

By Complexity:

EASY (30 minutes each):
  - Missing methods in ConsensusManager
  - Simple broadcast implementation
  - Fix block addition to chain
  Estimated: 3-4 issues

MEDIUM (1-2 hours each):
  - Fork resolution algorithm
  - UTXO consistency fixes
  - Mining reward distribution
  Estimated: 4-5 issues

HARD (2-4 hours each):
  - Network sync protocol
  - Multi-node consensus coordination
  - State consistency across reorgs
  Estimated: 2-3 issues

Total Estimated Fix Time:
  - Best Case:    4-5 hours (if only simple fixes needed)
  - Likely Case:  8-12 hours (combination of fixes)
  - Worst Case:   16-20 hours (if deeper architectural issues)

================================================================================
NOTES & OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

1. Pattern Recognition:
   - 100% failure rate on mining → implementation incomplete
   - 100% failure rate on consensus → methods missing/broken
   - 89% failure rate on network → broadcasting not implemented
   - 83% success on wallet → depends on above systems

2. Architecture Observations:
   - Missing ConsensusManager methods (3 ERROR tests)
   - No UTXO rollback on reorg (double-spend tests fail)
   - No network broadcast mechanism (propagation tests fail)
   - Block reward calculation issues (mining reward tests fail)

3. Testing Quality:
   - Tests are comprehensive and well-structured
   - Failures are clear and specific
   - Good integration test coverage
   - Easy to debug (one issue → multiple test failures)

4. Recovery Assessment:
   - Most failures are implementation gaps, not design flaws
   - Code structure appears sound (governance tests pass)
   - Quick wins possible with targeted fixes
   - Suggests recent incomplete refactoring or new feature branch
