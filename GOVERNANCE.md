# Governance

XAI is currently in early development with centralized governance that will progressively decentralize.

## Current Structure (Testnet Phase)

### Core Team
- Full decision-making authority during testnet
- Review and merge all PRs
- Coordinate releases and security patches
- Define roadmap priorities

### Contributors
- Submit PRs following CONTRIBUTING.md
- Participate in discussions and code reviews
- Report bugs and suggest improvements

## Becoming a Maintainer

1. Demonstrate sustained quality contributions
2. Show understanding of the Python codebase and architecture
3. Receive nomination from core team
4. Approval via consensus of current maintainers

## Decision Process

### Code Changes
1. **Proposal**: Author creates GitHub issue or PR
2. **Review**: Core team and community provide feedback
3. **Approval**: At least one core team approval required
4. **Merge**: Approved changes are merged to main

### Protocol Changes
1. **RFC**: Author creates detailed proposal in GitHub Discussions
2. **Discussion**: Community review period (minimum 7 days)
3. **Decision**: Core team makes final decision
4. **Implementation**: Approved changes are scheduled

## Future: On-Chain Governance

XAI plans to implement on-chain governance post-mainnet:

- Token-weighted voting for protocol parameters
- Community treasury management
- Validator selection and rewards

## Off-Chain Governance

- **GitHub Issues**: Feature requests and bug reports
- **GitHub Discussions**: Architecture decisions and RFCs
- **Discord**: Real-time community discussion

## Code Owners

See `.github/CODEOWNERS` for module ownership assignments.
