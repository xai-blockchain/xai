                           CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The Bandit security scan has identified 10 medium-severity findings in the
XAI blockchain codebase. The good news is that NO high-severity issues were
found, and all identified issues are actionable with straightforward fixes.

With implementation of the recommended remediation plan, the application will
achieve industry-standard security and be suitable for production deployment.

Comprehensive analysis documents have been generated with:
  - Detailed explanations of each finding
  - Code snippets and line numbers
  - Recommended fixes with examples
  - Implementation templates
  - Environment variable documentation
  - Testing procedures
  - CI/CD integration guidance

The remediation can be completed in 2-3 weeks with an estimated 14-21 hours
of development effort spread across three priority phases.
